A basic SASS framework with CSS Variables made for studying purposes.

## Features and TODOs
- [x] Typography, lists, links
- [x] HTML elements like Buttons, Form elements, tables
- [x] grid system based on flexbox
- [x] Components (tooltips, cards, sidebar, modals)


## Usage
To test things locally just install dependancies with `npm i`and run the local development server with `npm start`. To compile the css code from scsss just run `run prod-build`.
Adjust the `--output-style` by using `nested`, `expanded`, `compact` or `compressed` as desired.

## Bugs
- Uhm, many...!
